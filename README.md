# ADFM
In this work, a novel automatic isotropic triangle generation technique is developed by introducing an artificial neural network (ANN) based advancing double-front method (ADFM) to improve the mesh generation efficiency. First, an initial isotropic triangular mesh is generated by the traditional mesh generation method as the training set of ANN. Second, the ADFM is presented in detail to improve the advancing efficiency, including the structure of the ANN to distinguish the different patterns in the advancing procedure. Finally, several typical cases are tested to validate the effectiveness.
